A simple notebook manager for IPython
-------------------------------------

This package provides a minimal notebook manager for IPython.
It is meant to illustrate the notebook manager API.
This notebook manager stores all notebooks in memory, meaning
that they are lost when the server is stopped. It is completely
useless for practical applications.

The code has bee tested with Python 2.7 and 3.3.

Run the script `simple_notebook_manager_test` to start
an IPython notebook server with debug output enabled
and using the simple notebook manager.
